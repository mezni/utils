# Tasks: Sprint 1 — OSM Data & Station Discovery

**Date**: 2026-06-05 | **Status**: Ready for Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-sprint-1-foundation/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Overview

Sprint 1 implements OpenStreetMap data ingestion and geospatial station discovery for BorneMap. Four user stories organized by priority:

- **US1** (P1): Public Driver Discovers Nearby Charging Stations → MVP-blocking
- **US2** (P1): OSM Data Imported & Station Locations Synced → MVP-blocking, prerequisite for US1 testing
- **US3** (P2): Registered Driver Creates Favorites & Views Reviews → Post-MVP, independent
- **US4** (P2): Partner Views Their Own Stations → Post-MVP, independent

**MVP Scope**: US1 + US2 (public discovery with real OSM data)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 — OSM Data Imported & Station Locations Synced (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Import OpenStreetMap data for Tunisia; implement GIS projection layer and async sync worker to enable public discovery queries

**Independent Test**: DBA runs osm-import.sh script; verifies `gis.osm_ways` has 10k+ roads, `gis.station_locations` syncs from inventory.station, GIS queries return correct proximity results

**Est. Duration**: 16-20 hours

**Blocking Dependency**: US1 cannot test without OS data and working GIS sync

### OSM Data Import Infrastructure

- [ ] T035 Create osm2pgsql style configuration in `scripts/osm2pgsql-style.lua` (ways, nodes, relations for Tunisia)
- [ ] T036 Create OSM import script in `scripts/osm-import.sh` (wrapper for osm2pgsql; validates params, handles errors, creates indexes)
- [ ] T037 Create OSM import Dockerfile in `Dockerfile.osm` for containerized import process
- [ ] T038 [P] Add test data seed script in `scripts/seed-test-data.sql` (50+ stations, 5+ partners, test users for manual testing)

### GIS Sync Worker - Domain Layer

- [ ] T052 Create database trigger in `scripts/create_outbox_trigger.sql` (on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE of inventory.station, insert to station_outbox)
- [ ] T053 Execute trigger creation during schema migration (add to migration SQL or separate initialization script)

### GIS Data Validation

- [ ] T054 Create coordinate validation in `crates/ev-domain/src/geo.rs` (validate lat -90..90, lng -180..180)
- [ ] T055 Create Haversine distance function in `crates/ev-geo/src/distance.rs` (for application-level sorting if needed)

**Checkpoint**: OSM import script working; GIS sync worker polling and syncing; test data populated; ready for US1 discovery queries

## Phase 4: User Story 1 — Public Driver Discovers Nearby Charging Stations (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement `/api/v1/stations/nearby` public endpoint enabling users to find charging stations by geographic proximity without authentication

**Independent Test**: `GET /api/v1/stations/nearby?lat=36.8&lng=10.1&radius=5000` returns 10+ stations sorted by distance with names, addresses, availability, capacity

**Est. Duration**: 12-16 hours

- [ ] T069 [P] Create contract test US1-AC2 in `crates/driver-service/tests/contract/nearby_stations.rs` — empty radius returns empty list (not error)
- [ ] T070 [P] Create contract test US1-AC3 in `crates/driver-service/tests/contract/nearby_stations.rs` — invalid coordinates rejected with clear error message

### Integration Tests

- [ ] T071 Create integration test in `crates/driver-service/tests/integration/nearby_integration.rs` — setup test DB, populate 50+ stations, verify query latency <500ms p95, verify 100 concurrent searches

**Checkpoint**: Public discovery endpoint fully functional with real OSM data; contract tests passing; integration tests passing; MVP feature delivery ready

## Phase 5A: User Story 3 — Registered Driver Creates Favorites & Views Reviews (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement authenticated endpoints for registered drivers to save/view/remove station favorites; enable viewing reviews from other users

**Independent Test**: Authenticate as driver; POST /api/v1/favorites with station_id; GET /api/v1/favorites returns saved station; DELETE removes it

**Est. Duration**: 12-14 hours

**Can Run In Parallel With**: Phase 5B (US4), as they don't share implementation

- [ ] T091 Test soft-deleted station handling in `crates/driver-service/tests/integration/favorites_integration.rs` — favorite can point to deleted station (UI responsibility to hide)

**Checkpoint**: Favorites feature complete; user data isolation verified; integration tests passing

---

## Phase 5B: User Story 4 — Partner Views Their Own Stations (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement partner dashboard endpoints enabling business users to view ONLY their own stations with operational metrics (charger status, availability)

**Independent Test**: Partner A authenticates; GET /api/v1/partner/stations returns only Partner A's stations (no Partner B stations); 403 if attempting cross-partner access

**Est. Duration**: 14-16 hours

**Can Run In Parallel With**: Phase 5A (US3), as they don't share implementation

### Domain Layer

- [ ] T109 [P] Create contract test US4-AC2 in `crates/partner-service/tests/contract/partner_stations.rs` — station detail includes charger summary (available, in_use, etc.)
- [ ] T110 [P] Create contract test US4-AC3 in `crates/partner-service/tests/contract/partner_stations.rs` — 403 Forbidden when attempting to access another partner's station

### Integration Tests

- [ ] T133 Update docker-compose.yml to include all three services (driver, partner, gis-worker)
- [ ] T134 Create deployment guide in `/docs/deployment/sprint1-deployment.md` (manual steps, post-launch validation)

### Code Quality & Testing

- [ ] T136 Run cargo clippy --all to fix all warnings
- [ ] T137 Run rustfmt --all to format code
- [ ] T138 Generate test coverage report (coverage >80% for domain/application layers)

### Final Integration

- [ ] T140 Document test data setup in quickstart.md (scripts/seed-test-data.sql with expected counts)
- [ ] T141 Create rollback procedure documentation if any migrations fail (manual recovery steps)

**Checkpoint**: All code reviewed, tested, documented, containerized, and ready for production deployment

# Expected: 10+ stations sorted by distance_m
```

**US2 (OSM & GIS Sync)**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gis.osm_ways;  -- 10,000+
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gis.station_locations WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;  -- 50+
```

**US3 (Favorites)**:
```bash
# Authenticate, create favorite, list, delete
TOKEN=$(curl ... get jwt)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/favorites \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"station_id": "STN-..."}'
# Expected: 201 with favorite record
```

**US4 (Partner Stations)**:
```bash
# Authenticate as partner
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/api/v1/partner/stations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 with partner's stations only; no cross-partner access
```

### Dependency Notes

- **US2 blocks US1**: Cannot test public discovery without OSM data and working GIS sync
- **Phase 2 blocks all stories**: Auth, logging, DB schema required
- **US3 & US4 independent**: Can implement in parallel; don't depend on each other
- **No frontend work in Sprint 1**: Tasks focus on backend API; frontend consumes these endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Sprint Planning**: Use task estimates to schedule sprints (typically 2-week sprints at 40 hrs/week = ~2 complete phases)
2. **Team Assignment**: Assign Phase 1 to lead; Phase 2 to shared team; Phase 3-4 to backend team; Phase 5A-5B to separate teams (parallel); Phase 6 to all
3. **CI/CD Setup**: Before starting Phase 1, ensure GitHub Actions configured to run `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, Docker build
4. **Tracking**: Use tasks.md as source of truth in project management tool (Jira, Linear, etc.)
5. **Definition of Done**: Each task requires code review, passing tests, and documentation update

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Tasks Generated**: 2026-06-05 | **Feature Branch**: `004-sprint-1-foundation`

Proceed to Phase 1 setup or ask clarifying questions about estimates, dependencies, or task scope.
